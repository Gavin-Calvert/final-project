    <p id = "explain-basic" class = "explain">SUMMARY<br>In persona 5, you travel between the real world and the metaverse. Both of these places have many things to do that affect the other side.</p>
    <p id = "explain-persona" class = "explain">ACTIONS<br>There are many actions that can be performed in the real world in persona 5. Many of these actions impact (directly or indirectly) affect your performance in combat. Some examples include hanging out with friends, going to the batting cages, working out at the gym, meditating at a shrine, and more</p>
    <p id = "explain-item" class = "explain">TIME<br>In persona 5, you are working on a strict time limit. Unlike other games, you need to carefully manage your time in persona 5. This adds a whole other level of strategy to the game, especially considering the fact that your options can be limited by several factors</p>
    <p id = "explain-strategy" class = "explain">CONFIDANTS<br>This is my favorite part of peresona 5. (Most) of these characters are amazing, and have plenty of emotional moments. It isn't the fact that confidants give you benefits in combat, I prefer to do confidant stories just for the enjoyment of them.</p>
