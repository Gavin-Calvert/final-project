    <p id = "explain-basic" class = "explain">PERSONAL FAVORITES<br>Some of my personal favorite tracks from the game are Beneath The Mask, Rivers In The Desert, I Believe, Colors Flying High, and No More What Ifs</p>
    <p id = "explain-persona" class = "explain">INSTRUMENTALS<br>The persona 5 soundtrack has not only amazing singing performances, but also great instrumental tracks that fit the tone of the situation perfectly. In my opinion, the best example of this is Desire, which is pretty self-explanitory. It builds tension perfectly and truly makes the player feel like something terrible is about to happen</p>
    <p id = "explain-item" class = "explain">MOODS<br>The music from persona 5 can change between many different styles. From the laid back nature of a song like Beneath The Mask to the energetic Rivers In The Desert, the persona 5 soundtrack is an amazing one all throughout</p>
