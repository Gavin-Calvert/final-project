    <p id = "explain-persona" class = "explain">MENUS<br>The menus in persona 5 are some of the best in gaming, in my opinion. The main menu is such a good combination of being visually appealing, and being easy to navigate. All of the menu elements pop out in their own special ways, and the creative ways that the menus are displayed are never not breathtaking for me</p>
    <p id = "explain-item" class = "explain">ART STYLE<br>Due to it being an anime-style game, persona 5 is obviously very eccentric and expressive. Characters have incredibly creative designs, their costumes in the metaverse reflect their personalities perfectly, and everything comes together to make a beautiful game</p>
    <p id = "explain-strategy" class = "explain">CREATIVITY<br>The creativity in persona 5 really shows how much this game loves to show off. The way that the main character, joker, is interacting with all of the menus is truly genius. The way he holds up the main menu, swings across the screen in the settings menu, and do so many other things, just shows so much passion and personality</p>
